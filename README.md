Files detailing the code I have written so far to explore each of the 3 objectives of this project. 


Obj1 - What are the composite indicators and how do they compare against each other?

Obj2 - How do the composite indicators relate to the individual micronutrients?

Obj3 - How can we construct the composite indicators so that they are best representative of specific food group consumption?


The files are still being edited.
